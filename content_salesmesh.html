			ABOUT SALESMESH
		</p>
		<p class="content">
			I was one of two designers for a startup that created a personal CRM app called SalesMesh. I led a variety of projects, including the user onboarding redesign.
		</p>
		<p class="content">
			Salesmesh provided a way for outside sales reps to manage their &#8220;second book&#8221; of opportunities that they were not yet ready to share with their managers. This iOS app could sync data with Salesforce and let reps track their opportunities and contacts.

		PROBLEM OVERVIEW
		</p>
		</p><p class="content">
		We decided to redesign the onboarding flow because the metrics indicated a significant drop-off among first-time users. As a result of our redesign, the retention rate increased from 18% to 29%.

		SHORT TERM SOLUTION
		</p><p class="content">
		I started by conducting some interviews with experts on onboarding best practices. I also did research online and studied the onboarding strategies of other apps to learn about best practices. My key take-away was that successful apps must always <b>demonstrate their value to the user as soon as possible.</b>
		</p><p class="content">
		Our team decided to start with a short-term solution: redesign the intro carousel screens to emphasize value, and provide a &#8220;welcome dialog&#8221; to give new users access to an introductory overview video and other in-app tutorial videos. The goal was to more clearly communicate the value of our app, and showcase our top features.

		<p class="content article-header">
		LONG TERM SOLUTION
		</p><p class="content">
		I iterated through a series of 20 possible onboarding solutions and tested them with sales reps through usertesting.com. 
		</p><p class="content">
		Our final solution involved <b>indirectly inferring</b> which persona a user was based on a couple qualifying questions, then presenting a <b>tutorial</b> to highlight the feature most relevant to them. Each persona was presented with a mini tutorial highlighting the feature most relevant to them. They could also opt to do other tutorials afterward, or skip the tutorial and come back to it later in a new section of the app.
		</p><p class="content">
		The other solutions we tried included asking users to <b>self-identify</b> their needs, <b>screen-by-screen walkthroughs</b>, and <b>demo data</b>. None of these worked, because they required too much cognitive effort, were un-engaging, or posed too much risk to the user&#8217;s personal data, respectively. 
		</p>
		<p class="content">
		I created design specs for all device-specific variations, loading states, error states, and empty states that might occur. I also included where to track metrics, and provided animated prototypes to clearly communicate the new designs. Finally, I created all variations on the visual assets.

		FINAL IMPLEMENTATION
		</p>
		<p class="content">
		The video below shows the published onboarding experience. This demo would be for a new user who did not use Salesforce, and chose not to immediately import contacts or connect a calendar.

		REFLECTIONS
		</p>
		<p class="content">
		This project helped me understand that the most important aspect of onboarding is <b>how effectively you can show the value of your product to your user.</b> Also, I learned that it is vital to find as many ways as possible to reduce the work that users have to do to get to their first &#8220;win&#8221; in the app.
