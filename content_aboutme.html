			Hi! I&#8217;m Sheila. I&#8217;m a product designer based in the San Francisco bay area.</p>
		<p class="content"> Thanks for visiting my portfolio!
		</p><p class="content">
			I discovered product design after double-majoring in computer science and cognitive science at the University of Virginia, which led me to pursue a masters in Human-Computer Interaction from Carnegie Mellon University. I worked as a product designer on an iOS app at Salesmesh before joining Salesforce, where I work on the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/26/salesforce-field-service-lightning-the-fastest-growing-in-company-history.html">Field Service Lightning</a> design team.

		<p class="content">
			I learned a lot about user-centered design research methods through my experience at Carnegie Mellon University. As a mobile app designer, I try to stay up-to-date on any changes to Apple&#8217;s &#8220;Human Interface Guidelines,&#8221; and Google&#8217;s &#8220;Material Design.&#8221; I also listen to podcasts, read blogs, keep an eye on new products, and reference classic design books like Don Norman&#8217;s &#8220;Design of Everyday Things.&#8221;

		<p class="content">
			I love collaborating with interdisciplinary teams, and I firmly believe in the power of combining user-centered design with a deep understanding of technical and business constraints to solve real world problems.
