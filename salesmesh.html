				<p class="content-page-title">Salesmesh iOS app</p>
				<p class="content-page-subtitle">User onboarding redesign</p>

				<p>I was one of two designers for a startup that created a personal CRM app called SalesMesh. Salesmesh provided a way for outside sales reps to manage their &ldquo;second book&rdquo; of opportunities that they were not yet ready to share with their managers. This iOS app could sync data with Salesforce and let reps track their opportunities and contacts.</p>

				<p>I led a variety of projects, including the user onboarding redesign. We decided to redesign the onboarding flow because the metrics indicated a significant drop-off among first-time users. As a result of our redesign, the retention rate increased from 18% to 29%.</p>

				<p>My responsibilities included creating design specs, prototypes, and visual assets. I also interviewed active users and conducted usability tests. I defined personas and user flows. I also identified and analyzed key product metrics. Tools that I used included Sketch for design and exporting visual assets, Flinto for prototyping, userTesting.com for usability testing, HTML/CSS to send custom welcome emails to new users, Tableau to review metrics, and xCode to collaborate with engineers on implementation.</p>

				<p>I started the redesign by conducting interviews with experts on onboarding best practices. I also did research online and studied the onboarding strategies of other apps to learn about best practices. My key take-away was that successful apps must always demonstrate their value to the user as soon as possible.</p>

				<p>Our team decided to start with a short-term solution: redesign the intro carousel screens to emphasize value, and provide a &ldquo;welcome dialog&rdquo; to give new users access to an introductory overview video and other in-app tutorial videos. The goal was to more clearly communicate the value of our app, and showcase our top features.</p>

				<p class="content-caption">New Welcome Dialog (Short-Term Solution)</p>

				<p>For the longer term solution, I iterated through a series of 20 possible onboarding solutions and tested them with sales reps through usertesting.com. Our final solution involved indirectly inferring which persona a user was based on a couple qualifying questions, then presenting a tutorial to highlight the feature most relevant to them. Each persona was presented with a mini tutorial highlighting the feature most relevant to them. They could also opt to do other tutorials afterward, or skip the tutorial and come back to it later in a new section of the app.</p>

				<p>The other solutions we tried included asking users to self-identify their needs, screen-by-screen walkthroughs, and demo data. None of these worked, because they required too much cognitive effort, were un-engaging, or posed too much risk to the user&lsquo;s personal data, respectively.</p>

				<p>I created design specs for all device-specific variations, loading states, error states, and empty states that might occur. I also included where to track metrics, and provided animated prototypes to clearly communicate the new designs. Finally, I created all variations on the visual assets.</p>

				<p>This project helped me understand that the most important aspect of onboarding is how effectively you can show the value of your product to your user. Also, I learned that it is vital to find as many ways as possible to reduce the work that users have to do to get to their first &ldquo;win&rdquo; in the app.</p>
