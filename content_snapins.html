			ABOUT SNAP-INS
		</p>
		<p class="content">
			Salesforce Service Cloud <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/products/service-cloud/features/snap-ins/"><b>Lightning Snap-Ins</b></a> is a product that helps companies provide better customer service through their own websites and native mobile apps (both Android and iOS). Snap-Ins provides communication through <b>chat, cases, video chat, and articles.</b> The product is completey <b>configurable</b> to match the customer&#8217;s brand.
		</p>
		<p class="content">
			When I started at Salesforce, one of my early projects was to create a demo app to showcase Snap-Ins. I was the lead designer of a previous effort to translate the existing iOS designs for Snap-Ins onto the Android platform, so I was already very familiar with the Snap-Ins product. Below are some images showing how Snap-Ins communication channels might appear on an Android app for a green- and blue-branded company that sells camping gear.

			PROBLEM
		</p>
		<p class="content">
			Solution engineers (SEs) are people at Salesforce who help our customers get the most out of Salesforce products, tailored to their specific needs. SEs needed a way to communicate that value of Snap-Ins to customers via a demo app. I was tasked with creating internal apps on both iOS and Android that the SEs could use to run demos.
		</p>
		<p class="content article-header">
			RESEARCH
		</p>
		<p class="content">
			I started my project by conducting interviews with stakeholders and SEs to better understand their specific needs. I learned that SEs wanted a way to make the demo app look and feel as much like the customer&#8217;s real app as possible, and that they needed to be able to run the demo quickly, sometimes with very little notice.

			DESIGNS

		<p class="content">
			I suggested creating &#8220;Bookmarks&#8221; to keep track of different settings for different companies. The screens below show steps to setup bookmarks for hypothetical customers. Bookmarks contain specific brand and configuration settings per customer.

			REFLECTIONS
		</p>
		<p class="content">
			I really enjoyed working on this project because I had <b>direct access to my end users,</b> which made research much easier, both for intial discovery calls and for feedback on designs. I also had a <b>small, dedicated team</b> working on just this app for a short time, which helped us move fast even with few resources.
		</p>
		<p class="content">
			We ran into a constraint in which it was not possible to implement the same designs on both Android and iOS for technical reasons. As a result, I had to quickly revise the designs for the Android app. This experience helped me understand the importance of always being <b>closely aligned with developers</b> to ensure that designs are not only great UX, but also feasible to build.
