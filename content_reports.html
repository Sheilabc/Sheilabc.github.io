			I have gotten to work on some very interesting projects in the field of HCI throughout my academic studies.
		</p><p class="content article-header">
		VOLCANO SALVATION GAME
		</p><p class="content">
			I took a course on Game Design at the Madeira Interactive Technologies Institute while completing my masters in HCI. We created a video game that combined a Leap Motion hand tracking device and a webcam with facial tracking software. 
		</p><p class="content">
			Our team project was the <b>winner of the CHI 2014 student game design competition.</b> I wrote a <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262066432_Volcano_Salvation_Interaction_Through_Gesture_and_Head_Tracking" target="_blank">conference paper</a> for CHI describing our project&#8217;s contribution to the field of HCI. Leap Motion wrote a <a href="http://blog.leapmotion.com/becoming-an-aztec-god-with-leap-motion-head-tracking/" target="_blank">blog post</a> about the use of their device for our project. We also created the following <a href="https://vimeo.com/83607285" target="_blank">demo video</a>.

		EAT & TRAVEL CAPSTONE
		</p><p class="content">
			I completed a capstone project with a small team as part of my masters degree. Our task was to support a company that was hoping to design a new &#8220;virtual reality&#8221; theme restaurant.
		</p><p class="content">
			We created a website to help orient both investors and new customers to the proposed experience. <a href="https://vimeo.com/86051062" target="_blank"><b>This demo video</a></b> summarizes our final concept.

			MACHINE LEARNING PROJECT
		</p><p class="content">
			I took a course on machine learning while completing my masters in HCI at Carnegie Mellon University. Below is my <a href="./materials/Gender-prediction-from-blog-posts.pdf" target="_blank"><b>final project</b></a>, identifying gender based on a blog post writing sample.
